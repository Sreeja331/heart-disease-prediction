# heart-disease-prediction-work flow
heart data-1.This data set contains several health parameters which you know corresponds to a person's healthiness of the art.
first we need our dataset so once we have a data set we need process this data set to make it fit and compatible for our machine learning algorithm to learn. 
So once we process the data we need to split our data into training and testing the data.We often train the machine learning algorithm with training data and evaluate the performance of our model using the test data.we will split our original data into training and testing the data.
we will feed our training data to our machine learning model in this case we are going to use logisitic regression model by using this  case binary classification.this binary classification tells the person has health disease or not.
In binary classification the logistic  regression model is very helpful it is the best model when it comes to binary classification.once we trains this logisitic regression model into training data  we wil do some evaluation based on its performance So we will get a trained logisitc regression model whe predict any data availablee in the dataset which may tell the person contains the health disease or not.
Now we may write the code regrading on the project.
